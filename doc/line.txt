*line.txt*	vim "inner line" text object.

Author: Bruno Sutic <https://www.github.com/bruno->

INTRODUCTION					*line*

Vim "inner line" text object works on the text inside the line. Leading and
trailing whitespace is ignored.

"Around line" mappings are unnecessary because vim has those built in.
Check |cc|, |yy|, |dd|


OPERATOR MAPS					*line-maps*

						*line-_* *line-<underscore>*
_ <underscore>		Operator map that selects text inside the line,
			ignoring the leading and trailing whitespace.
			Equivalent to '^vg_' + |operator|.

						*g:line_default_mappings*
To disable default map, add the following to your vimrc:
>
  let g:line_default_mappings = 0
<
EXAMPLES					*line-examples*

v_			Visually selects all the text in a line, except the
			leading and trailing whitespace.
